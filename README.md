With a background in academic science and an interest in art, I enjoy both the technically rigorous aspects of application development and the creative aspects of visual design. I always aim to write clean, testable code, take mindful and user-centred approaches to design, and employ pair-programming and agile practices. I am particularly interested in using technology to tackle social and environmental problems, and to improve our health and wellbeing.
